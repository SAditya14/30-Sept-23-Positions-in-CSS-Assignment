Position relative:
In position as relative we can shift our image anywhere without impacting our sibling, it works with respect to our viewport.

Position absolute:
absolute works with respect to it's parent, for example we can use position absolute w.r.t position relative as we did in question 1.

NOTE: Position Absolute comes in new layer w.r.t it's parent.
